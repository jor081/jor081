<h1><b>ALL SEASONS WIKIPEDIA</b></h1>
<p> American Horror Story presents an anthology of stories for each new season, or installment. <br>
    The first season revolved around the Harmon family in a <i> haunted house. </i> <br>
    <i> Asylum </i> committed us through the 1960s.<br>
    <i> Coven </i> left us spellbound in New Orleans with an all-star cast.<br>
    The spectacular <i> Freak Show </i> was set in 1950's Florida; only by entering Fr√§ulein Elsa's Cabinet of Curiosities will you learn its secrets.<br>
    <i> Hotel </i> checked in at the sinister Hotel Cortez, built by a serial killer to hide his victim's corpses and currently owned by Countess Elizabeth, carrier of an ancient "blood virus".<br>
    The lost colony of <i> Roanoke </i> makes for terrifying television when stars collide.<br>
    The <i> Cult </i> forced us to embrace our most terrifying fears.<br>
<i> 1884 </i> took us on a summer trip to Camp Redwood for an 80s slasher experience.<br>
    <i> Double Feature </i> told us two horrifying stories. One by the sea. One by the sand. </p><br>
