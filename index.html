The "Murder House" is built by Dr. Charles Montgomery, an acclaimed surgeon to the stars, for his wife, Nora, and their son, Thaddeus. Charles eventually becomes addicted to drugs and develops a terrifying Frankenstein complex. Nora begins sending in young women to receive abortions from the doctor, but one of the girls lets the secret slip, and the father of her aborted baby takes revenge by stealing Charles and Nora's child and returning him to the couple in jars. Dr. Montgomery then attempts to bring the child back to life by sewing him together, and placing one of their girl's hearts in him. To which girl he used the heart of, we'll never know. When Nora sees the new and improved Thaddeus, who seems to crave blood and flesh rather than her milk, she tries to kill him. In a maniacal state, Nora shoots her husband, then herself, thus ending both of their lives.<br>
